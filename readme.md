# Project file strucure

Here's an overview of the structure:

* `timelog.md` The time log for your project.
* `readme.md` The readme you are currently using
* `data/` user data aquired in the studies
* `src/` source code for the elm project
* `status_report/` the status report submitted in December
* `dissertation/` the dissertation pdf and source code required to build it
* `presentation/` my presentation slides

in the elm project, the files are structured as follows:
* `elm-stuff/` automatically generated elm files
* `fonts/` fonts used for the website
* `gen/` files generated by latex2elm.js
* `js/` automatically generated javascript files
* `latex/` the .tex files used in the project
* `src/` where the .elm files and favicon for the project are
* `styles/` automatically generated file containing CSS for displaying katex
* `elm.json` manages elm packages
* `index.html` html file used to run the project
* `latex2elm.js` used to translate the files in latex/ into elm

inside the elm project's src, the files are:
* `Arrows.elm` which exports the view function for the arrows to move between nodes
* `Color.elm` which exports the colours used throughout the program and functions which operate on them
* `Context.elm` handles reading of the CSS variables
* `Cube.elm` exports the view function for the rendered cube
* `ExplainationBox.elm` exports the view fucntion for the explaination box
* `favicon.png` containst the site's favicon
* `Footer.elm` exports the view function that makes the settings & guide footers
* `Home.elm` exports is the main file, holds the model, messages and main function
* `ProcessionButtons.elm` exports the view function that makes the buttons in the lower right to guide a user through the page
* `Property.elm` defines and exports the three type systems and the colours they use
* `ReductionBox.elm` exports the view function that makes the box containing beta reduction rules
* `ReferenceButtons.elm` exports the view function that makes the buttons to open the reference footer
* `ReferenceFooter.elm` exports the view function that makes the reference footer
* `Sidebar.elm` exports the view function that makes the buttons on the left of the screen used to navigate the cube
* `System.elm` defines the type System, as well as functions used to derive state from it
* `Tite.elm` exports the view function that makes the title
* `TransferGrid.elm` exports the view function that places buttons over each node of the cube, which can be clicked on to zoom in
* `Utils.elm` exports the px function that converts a number into view widths

## Translator

* The translator I made is stored at src/ , and is called latex2elm.js.
* It expects to work on .tex files in the src/latex directory, and will generate .elm files in the src/gen file
* To recompile all of the .tex files, use the command `deno run --allow-read --allow-write latex2elm.js latex/*.tex` in the /src directory, or to recompile just one replace the "*" with the file name

## Building the project

* in the src/ directory, run the command `elm-live src/Home.elm -- --output="js/Home.js"`, which will start the project on localhost:8000/
